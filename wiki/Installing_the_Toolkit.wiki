Steps to checkout

   # Create a new project in Eclipse and accept all the defaults.
   # Go to Window > Open Perspective > Other and select *SVN Repository Exploring*
   # Add a new repository: http://force4facebook.googlecode.com/svn/branches/force4facebook3_toolkit/
   # Navigate to force4facebook3/src and right-click the folder.
         # Go to export and enter the name of your new project when prompted for a project name.
         # You will be asked to delete and overwrite the existing project. Accept this.
   # Return to the Force.com IDE perspective and refresh your project to see the Force.com for Facebook items added to the project.
   # Do the same for the sample application

== Activate Force.com Sites ==

   # Go to *Setup > Develop > Sites*
   # Create and register a Force.com Domain
   # Click *New* to create a new site for this domain
         # Enter a *Site Label*, such as 'FB Example'
         # *Site Name* will be autopopulated as <font size="4pt">{{{'FB_Example'}}}</font>
         # Select your user account as a *Site Contact*
         # Check the *Active* checkbox
         # Keep the rest of the options on their default settings

== Allowing for Authentication of Users ==

In order to adhere to the Salesforce terms of service, we must use the Salesforce Customer Portal in order to authenticate users, rather than writing our own methods for user authentication.

   # Go to *Setup > Customize > Customer Portal > Settings*
   # Click *Edit* and check the *Enable Customer Portal* checkbox
   # Click *Cancel* to skip the Customer Portal User Wizard
   # Click *Edit* next to the newly created Customer Portal
         # Ensure that *Login Enabled* is checked
         # Set your user account to be the *Administrator User*
         # Check the *Self-Registration Enabled* checkbox
         # Set *Default New User License* to 'Customer Portal Manager'
         # Set *Default New User Role* to 'User'
         # Set *Default New User Profile* to 'Customer Portal Manager'


== Creating Tabs For Our New Objects ==

   # Go to *Setup > Create > Tabs*
   # Click *New* in 'Custom Object Tabs'
         # Select *GFCUser* as the object
         # Select any tab style
         # Click *Next* and make the tab visible only for the 'System Administrator'
         # Click *Next* and make the tab available only to the 'Force.com' app or any other app of your choosing
         # Repeat for the *Site Config* object

== Setting up a Facebook Application ==

   # Go to [http://www.facebook.com Facebook.com] and login
   # Add the *Developer* application to your Facebook account
   # Click on *Setup New Application* within the Developer application
   # Give it a name. Keep in mind you can't use 'Facebook' or any variation of that word in the name of your application
   # Make note of your *API Key* and *Secret*, you will need these in Salesforce
   # Click on the *Connect* item in the sidebar and set your *Connect URL* to the domain of your Force.com Site (http://sitename-developer-edition.na7.force.com)
   # Click on the *Advanced* menu item and ensure that the *Application Type* is set to 'Web'
   # Click *Save Changes*

== Setup a Portal User ==

   # Go to the Accounts tab
   # Create a new account with the name of 'Facebook Portal' and any basic information you desire
   # Now we must setup role for the owner of the Portal User Account
         # Click on the Account Owner
         # Give the User a role. It can be any role.
   # Return to the Account and retrieve the Salesforce ID for the record from the end of the URL
   # Now we can add the Portal User Account Salesforce ID to the Force.com Site
         # Return to the Force.com IDE
         # Find the *!SiteRegisterController* class
         # Change the following line to include your Account ID
               # private static Id PORTAL_ACCOUNT_ID = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx';
         # Save the class

   # Create a *New* record for 'Site Config'
         # Enter the *Site Name* as it is found in your Force.com Sites configuration, in this case: <font size="4pt">{{{'FB Example'}}}</font>
         # Enter the *API Key* from your Facebook developer application
         # Enter your *Facebook Application Secret*
         # Lookup the *Portal User Account* that you created earlier
         # *Save* the record

         # Click *Edit* on the new 'Facebook Portal User' profile

               # Set GFC Users to *Read, Create, Edit*
